## 🧠 What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is an AI technique where:

1. Your PDF is broken into small chunks
2. Each chunk is converted into numbers (embeddings)
3. When you ask a question, the most relevant chunks are found
4. An AI model reads those chunks and gives you an accurate answer

Think of it like giving an AI a book to read, then asking it questions about it!

## ⚙️ How Each File Works

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `loader.py` | Reads all PDFs from the `data/` folder |
| `splitter.py` | Cuts PDF text into 1000-character chunks |
| `embeddings.py` | Uses HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to convert text to vectors |
| `vectorstore.py` | Saves vectors in ChromaDB for fast searching |
| `rag_chain.py` | Searches relevant chunks + sends to Groq LLaMA 3 for answer |
| `app.py` | Streamlit web app — the UI you interact with |

## 🚀 Getting Started (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Smart-PDF-RAG-Chatbot.git
cd Smart-PDF-RAG-Chatbot
```

### Step 2 — Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
- **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
- **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`

### Step 3 — Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Set Up API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```

Get your free keys here:
- 🔑 Groq API Key → https://console.groq.com
- 🔑 HuggingFace Token → https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

### Step 5 — Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 6 — Use the App
1. Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser
2. Upload one or more PDF files from the sidebar
3. Click **"🚀 Process Documents"**
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Ask any question about your PDF in the chat box!
